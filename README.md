9. Difficulty and Impression<br>
   At first, I think javaFX is so difficult and I can't reach it but now I can use VBox, HBox and other things fluently although I am not good at javaFX. Now hava difficulty showing products in many lines, I want to have three products in a line but I haven't finished it yet and all products are in a lines. I was surprised at calling a function in itself.
